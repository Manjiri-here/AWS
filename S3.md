After creating bucket I uploaded an object to it.
By default the object uploaded is always private. Hence by going into buckets 'Permission' you need to turn OFF the block all public access. And also enable ACLs on bucket and object level both. Only then you will be able to make the object public to internet

Else you will keep seeing the: AccessDenied error

Note: before giving any permission read the disciption and only allow if the access is needed. Else consult people in the organization.

Bucket level permission:

Once permissions are given you will start seeing the page/website:
