provider "aws" {                # Terraform does not require account details explicity as it uses same logic as AWS CLI to get the account details.
  region = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_vpc" "default" {       # “Hey Terraform, go into AWS and find the default VPC that already exists in this account and region. I want to read its details. data= read
  default = true                 # Later you use it like: data.aws_vpc.default.id
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {        # Terraform resource name is for Terraform’s brain. bucket is the real AWS identity. Tags are for finance, security, and operations.”
    bucket = "demobucket-goodday-04122025"
    tags={

    }
}

After creating bucket using Terraform , I uploaded an object to the bucket.
By default the object uploaded is always private. Hence by going into buckets 'Permission' you need to turn OFF the block all public access. And also enable ACLs on bucket and object level both. Only then you will be able to make the object public to internet

Else you will keep seeing the: AccessDenied error

Note: before giving any permission read the disciption and only allow if the access is needed. Else consult people in the organization.

Bucket level permission:

Object level ACL:

Once permissions are given you will start seeing the page/website:

Versioning: 

Enable verioning on the bucket level:

Versioning can be suspended but not disabled, so the already existing versions will be available.

Now upload a new file and make changes in the same file and upload it again with the same name. In the versions section inside the object you will start seeing the versions:

Note that when you select Show Version, the Amazon S3 URL now includes the version ID in the query string after the object name: https://demobucket-goodday-04122025.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/foo.txt?versionId=Id13gu7bulRDz7NhSJbUeXxmugUzODGG

Uner 'Management' in Amazon S3 buckets you will see the Lifecycle configuration as below:
