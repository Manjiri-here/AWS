Lambda 

It is a compute service. 
It is serverless service , where you do not need to manage server, server exists but you do nt need to manage it, hence the name serverless. You just give code to it and its runs it.
You give conditions at which a code is to be executed to code is to be triggered then Lambda can be used. These are basic use cases.
Pay model: Pay per run, means if it runs for 200 ms then you will need to pay for only 200ms only. (Another example for serverless is DynamoDB)
At the backend the service and code we give runs on very light weight machine using firefly which is aws internal technology.

AWS lambda logs can be monitored very simply using cloudwatch
